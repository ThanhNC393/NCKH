# NCKH – Fuzzy-Clustering & Related Algorithms

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains implementations (in [your language / framework]) of clustering algorithms — especially Fuzzy C‑Means clustering (FCM) and related fuzzy clustering / soft-clustering methods.  
Rather than assigning each data point to a single cluster (as in hard clustering), FCM gives each point a *membership degree* to each cluster (between 0 and 1), allowing overlapping and uncertain cluster membership — which can better model datasets with ambiguous or overlapping structure. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This is useful for applications in data mining, pattern recognition, image segmentation, or any domain where rigid cluster boundaries may not reflect reality.
